Race condition
--------------
A race condition is a special condition that may occur inside a critical section. A critical section is a section of code that is executed by multiple 
threads and where the sequence of execution for the threads makes a difference in the result of the concurrent execution of the critical section. 

When the result of multiple threads executing a critical section may differ depending on the sequence in which the threads execute, the critical section 
is said to contain a race condition. The term race condition stems from the metaphor that the threads are racing through the critical section, and that the 
result of that race impacts the result of executing the critical section.
